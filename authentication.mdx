## Authentication Overview

The Limestone Networks API uses Bearer token authentication. All API requests must include an `Authorization` header with your API token.

## Getting Your API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Log into [OnePortal](https://one.limestonenetworks.com) with your Limestone Networks account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Settings">
    Go to Account Settings > API Tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Token">
    Click "Create New Token" and provide a descriptive name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and Secure">
    Copy your token immediately - it won't be shown again. Store it securely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Token

Include your token in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

```bash
curl https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/current_user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Token Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never share your API token or commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
</Warning>

- **Rotate tokens regularly** - Generate new tokens periodically and revoke old ones
- **Use environment variables** - Store tokens in environment variables, not in code
- **Limit scope** - Create separate tokens for different applications
- **Monitor usage** - Review API activity for unauthorized access

## Example: Environment Variable Usage

```bash
# Set your token as an environment variable
export LIMESTONE_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Use it in API calls
curl https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/current_user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LIMESTONE_API_TOKEN"
```

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing token |
| 403 | Forbidden - Token doesn't have required permissions |

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Wait before retrying.
