## Getting Started with Limestone Networks

This guide will walk you through deploying your first server using the Limestone Networks API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. A Limestone Networks account - [Sign up here](https://one.limestonenetworks.com)
2. An API token from your account dashboard
3. An SSH key for server access

## Step 1: Generate an API Token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log into OnePortal">
    Navigate to [one.limestonenetworks.com](https://one.limestonenetworks.com) and sign in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access API Settings">
    Go to your account settings and find the API tokens section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Token">
    Generate a new token and save it securely - you won't be able to see it again
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Upload Your SSH Key

Before provisioning a server, upload your SSH public key:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/sshkey \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-key",
    "pubkey": "ssh-ed25519 AAAA... user@hostname"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Check Available Inventory

List available server configurations at your preferred facility:

```bash
curl https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/facility/DFW1/stock \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Step 4: Provision a Server

Deploy a bare metal server with your configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/instance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-server",
    "hostname": "server.example.com",
    "facility": "DFW1",
    "core": "bm1.e2234.1",
    "image": "almalinux-8",
    "ssh_keys": ["my-key"],
    "project_id": "PROJ-xxxxxxxx"
  }'
```

## Step 5: Monitor Provisioning

Check the status of your provisioning job:

```bash
curl https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/job/JOB_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```
