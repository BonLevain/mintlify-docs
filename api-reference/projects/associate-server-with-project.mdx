title: 'Associate Server with Project'
api: 'POST /project/{project_id}/server/{server_id}'
description: 'Associate an existing server with a project'
---

## Overview

Associates an existing bare metal server with a specified project. This endpoint is used when you have a server that was provisioned outside of the project system (such as a legacy server) and want to bring it under project management for better organization and billing.

Unlike the [Add Server to Project](/api-reference/projects/add-server-to-project) endpoint which provisions a new server, this endpoint links an existing server to a project without any provisioning.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="project_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the project to associate the server with (e.g., `PROJ-9bf66e73`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="server_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the server to associate with the project
</ParamField>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="server_id" type="string" required>
  The server ID to associate with the project. This should match the path parameter.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73/server/srv-12345678" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "server_id=srv-12345678"
```

```python Python

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73/server/srv-12345678",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"},
    data={"server_id": "srv-12345678"}
)
print(response.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73/server/srv-12345678', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'

  body: new URLSearchParams({
    server_id: 'srv-12345678'
  })
});
const result = await response.json();
```

## Response Fields

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A human-readable message describing the result of the operation
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the operation was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`)
</ResponseField>

## Server Eligibility

Not all servers can be associated with a project. A server must meet the following criteria:

- The server must belong to your account
- The server must not already be associated with another project
- The server must be in an active state

If a server is not eligible, you will receive a `400 Bad Request` response with details about why the association failed.

## Notes

- Once a server is associated with a project, its billing will be consolidated under that project
- To remove a server from a project, use the [Delete Project Server](/api-reference/projects/delete-project-server) endpoint
- You can view all servers in a project using the [Get Project Instances](/api-reference/projects/get-project-instances) endpoint
