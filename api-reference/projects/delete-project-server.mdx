title: 'Delete Project Server'
api: 'DELETE /project/{project_id}/server/{server_id}'
description: 'Delete a server from a project by canceling the instance'
---

## Overview

Deletes a server from the specified project by canceling the instance. This is a destructive operation that will terminate the server and release its resources.

The deletion process is asynchronous. Upon successful request, you receive a Job object that you can monitor to track the deletion progress.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="project_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the project containing the server (e.g., `PROJ-9bf66e73`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="server_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the server to delete (e.g., `SRV-a1b2c3d4`)
</ParamField>

## Query Parameters

<ParamField query="wait" type="boolean" default="false">
  When set to `true`, the API will wait for the deletion job to complete before returning. When `false` (default), the API returns immediately with a Job object you can poll.
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73/server/SRV-a1b2c3d4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73/server/SRV-a1b2c3d4",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
)
print(response.json())
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73/server/SRV-a1b2c3d4', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
  }
});
const job = await response.json();
```

## Response Fields

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  Timestamp when the job was created (ISO 8601 format)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updated_at" type="string">
  Timestamp when the job was last updated (ISO 8601 format)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Current status of the deletion job (e.g., `Pending`, `Running`, `Complete`, `Failed`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  Internal job type name
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="job_identifier" type="string">
  Unique identifier for tracking the job. Use this with the [Get Job](/api-reference/jobs/get-job) endpoint to monitor progress.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="display_name" type="string">
  Human-readable name for the job
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metadata" type="array">
  Array of key-value pairs containing job metadata
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="statuses" type="array">
  Array of status updates as the job progresses
</ResponseField>

## Monitoring Deletion

After initiating a server deletion, use the returned `job_identifier` to monitor the deletion progress:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/job/job-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Notes

- This operation is irreversible. All data on the server will be permanently lost.
- Any IP addresses assigned to the server will be released back to the project's IP pool.
- Billing for the server will stop once the deletion is complete.
- You can also delete instances directly using the [Delete Instance](/api-reference/instances/delete-instance) endpoint.
