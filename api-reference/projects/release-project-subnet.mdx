title: "Release Project Subnet"
openapi: "DELETE /v2/project/{project_id}/subnet"
---

Release an IP subnet from a project. This deallocates the IP prefix from the project, making it available for reallocation.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="project_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier (UUID) of the project that the prefix is allocated to.
</ParamField>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="prefix" type="string" required>
  The IP prefix to release from the project (e.g., "192.168.1.0/24").
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns a [Result](/api-reference/schemas/result) object confirming the deallocation.

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/{project_id}/subnet" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "prefix=192.168.1.0/24"
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "message": "IP prefix deallocated successfully",
  "status": true
}
```

## Error Responses

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Bad request - Invalid subnet format or subnet cannot be released |
| 403 | Unauthorized - You don't have permission to release this subnet |
| 422 | Invalid parameters - The prefix parameter is invalid |

## Use Cases

- **Resource Cleanup**: Release unused IP subnets when they're no longer needed
- **IP Management**: Free up IP addresses for use in other projects
- **Cost Optimization**: Deallocate unused IP resources to reduce costs

## Important Notes

<Warning>
Before releasing a subnet, ensure that no instances are actively using IP addresses from this subnet. Releasing a subnet that is in use may cause network connectivity issues.
