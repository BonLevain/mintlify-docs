## Overview

Deletes a project from your account. This operation is irreversible. Before deleting a project, you must first delete or disassociate all resources within the project, including instances, IP subnets, and other dependent resources.

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="project_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the project to delete (e.g., `PROJ-9bf66e73` or the full UUID)
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    "https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}
)
print(response.status_code)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.dallas-idc.com/v2/project/PROJ-9bf66e73', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN'
  }
});
console.log(response.status);
```

</RequestExample>

</ResponseExample>

## Prerequisites

Before deleting a project, ensure the following:

1. **No active instances**: All servers within the project must be deleted or cancelled
2. **No assigned IP subnets**: Release all IP blocks allocated to the project
3. **No pending jobs**: Wait for any in-progress operations to complete

## Use Cases

- **Cleanup unused projects**: Remove projects that are no longer needed
- **Account organization**: Delete test or development projects after they've served their purpose
- **Resource decommissioning**: Final step after migrating all resources to a different project

## Notes

- This operation returns a `202 Accepted` status code, indicating the delete request has been accepted
- The deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Billing for the project will cease once the delete is complete
- If the project contains any active resources, the API will return a `400 Bad Request` error
