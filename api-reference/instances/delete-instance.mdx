## Deletion Process

When you delete an instance:

1. **Job Created** - A deletion job is queued and a job ID is returned
2. **Services Stopped** - Running services and processes are terminated
3. **Network Released** - IP addresses and network configurations are released
4. **Storage Wiped** - Server disks are securely wiped
5. **Hardware Deallocated** - The physical server is returned to the inventory pool

<Warning>
  This action is irreversible. All data on the instance will be permanently destroyed. Make sure to back up any important data before deleting an instance.
</Warning>
