## Overview

This endpoint sends a power off command to the specified instance. Use this to gracefully shut down an instance that is currently running.

  The power off command is sent asynchronously. The API will return a success response once the command has been accepted, but the instance may take some time to fully shut down.

## Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
